# General-Social-Survey-GSS-Data-Analysis

Since 1972, the General Social Survey (GSS) has been monitoring societal change and studying the growing complexity of American society. The GSS aims to gather data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes; to examine the structure and functioning of society in general as well as the role played by relevant subgroups; to compare the United States to other societies in order to place American society in comparative perspective and develop cross-national models of human society.

GSS questions cover a diverse range of issues including national spending priorities, marijuana use, crime and punishment, race relations, quality of life, confidence in institutions, and sexual behavior.

We are all well acquainted to the fact that homosexuals, especially during most part of the time prior to the 21st century, were wrongly frowned upon and shamed by the society, who treated them as a diseased section of people. Moreover, homosexual relationships were even more disgusted and rebelled by wider sections of the society. In contrast to these situations in the previous century, the United States of America in 2003 granted LGBT(Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) rights and in 2015 legalised same-sex marriage.

In this research analysis, the shift of opinion of the general public of the United States towards the concept of homosexual relationships has been recorded and visualized untill 2012, also concrete evidence has been provided which signifies the fact that this shift has been dependent on the years passing by untill 2012.
